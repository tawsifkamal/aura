## Codebase Patterns
- Claude Code custom skills go in `.claude/commands/<skill-name>.md` at project root
- Monorepo uses Turborepo with `apps/` and `packages/` workspaces
- Existing Python demo-recorder in `packages/demo-recorder/` — PRD requires TypeScript-only for core flow
- Project uses npm (not yarn/pnpm), see `package-lock.json`
- Quality checks: `turbo run build`, `turbo run lint`, `turbo run check-types`
- New Node.js packages: extend `@repo/typescript-config/base.json`, add `eslint.config.js` with `@repo/eslint-config/base`, set `type: "module"`
- Core utilities live in `packages/core/src/` — import with `@repo/core` or `@repo/core/<module>`

## 2026-02-28 - US-001
- Created `/record-demo` Claude Code skill at `.claude/commands/record-demo.md`
- Skill is discoverable via `/record-demo` command (confirmed in skill listing)
- Contains full placeholder prompt structure: diff analysis, web app detection, dev server startup, browser-use recording, Screen Studio-style post-processing, and output reporting
- TypeScript-only baseline — no Python runtime dependency in the skill prompt
- Files changed: `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Claude Code discovers skills from `.claude/commands/` directory automatically
  - The skill appears in the available skills list immediately after file creation
  - Existing `packages/plugin/skills/record-demo/SKILL.md` is the old Python-based version; the new `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` supersedes it
  - PRD says `~/.claude/commands/` (home dir) but project-level `.claude/commands/` is correct for project-scoped skills

## 2026-02-28 - US-002
- Created `@repo/core` package at `packages/core/` with TypeScript utilities
- `diff-analyzer.ts`: parses `git diff --name-status`, classifies files as component/page/route, deduplicates
- `web-app-detector.ts`: reads `package.json`, detects framework (Next.js, React, Vue, Vite, Angular, Svelte, Nuxt, Remix, Astro), finds dev script and port
- `route-inferrer.ts`: infers affected routes from changed file paths with confidence levels (high/medium/low), supports Next.js App Router, Pages Router, and generic patterns
- `index.ts`: re-exports all public APIs and types
- Updated `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` skill with detailed Step 1 instructions for diff analysis, web app detection, and route inference
- Files changed: `packages/core/` (new package), `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` (updated), `package-lock.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - New packages need `eslint.config.js` importing from `@repo/eslint-config/base` for lint to work
  - Use `@repo/typescript-config/base.json` (not react-library) for Node.js-only packages
  - Package `type: "module"` and `.js` extensions in imports are required for NodeNext module resolution
  - The `parseDiffNameStatus` function is exported separately so it can be unit-tested without git
  - Route inference confidence levels help the browser agent prioritize which routes to visit
