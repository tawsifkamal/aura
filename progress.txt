## Codebase Patterns
- Claude Code custom skills go in `.claude/commands/<skill-name>.md` at project root
- Monorepo uses Turborepo with `apps/` and `packages/` workspaces
- Existing Python demo-recorder in `packages/demo-recorder/` — PRD requires TypeScript-only for core flow
- Project uses npm (not yarn/pnpm), see `package-lock.json`
- Quality checks: `turbo run build`, `turbo run lint`, `turbo run check-types`
- New Node.js packages: extend `@repo/typescript-config/base.json`, add `eslint.config.js` with `@repo/eslint-config/base`, set `type: "module"`
- Core utilities live in `packages/core/src/` — import with `@repo/core` or `@repo/core/<module>`
- ESLint `--max-warnings 0` means NO unused vars allowed (even with `_` prefix) — remove unused params entirely

## 2026-02-28 - US-001
- Created `/record-demo` Claude Code skill at `.claude/commands/record-demo.md`
- Skill is discoverable via `/record-demo` command (confirmed in skill listing)
- Contains full placeholder prompt structure: diff analysis, web app detection, dev server startup, browser-use recording, Screen Studio-style post-processing, and output reporting
- TypeScript-only baseline — no Python runtime dependency in the skill prompt
- Files changed: `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Claude Code discovers skills from `.claude/commands/` directory automatically
  - The skill appears in the available skills list immediately after file creation
  - Existing `packages/plugin/skills/record-demo/SKILL.md` is the old Python-based version; the new `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` supersedes it
  - PRD says `~/.claude/commands/` (home dir) but project-level `.claude/commands/` is correct for project-scoped skills

## 2026-02-28 - US-002
- Created `@repo/core` package at `packages/core/` with TypeScript utilities
- `diff-analyzer.ts`: parses `git diff --name-status`, classifies files as component/page/route, deduplicates
- `web-app-detector.ts`: reads `package.json`, detects framework (Next.js, React, Vue, Vite, Angular, Svelte, Nuxt, Remix, Astro), finds dev script and port
- `route-inferrer.ts`: infers affected routes from changed file paths with confidence levels (high/medium/low), supports Next.js App Router, Pages Router, and generic patterns
- `index.ts`: re-exports all public APIs and types
- Updated `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` skill with detailed Step 1 instructions for diff analysis, web app detection, and route inference
- Files changed: `packages/core/` (new package), `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` (updated), `package-lock.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - New packages need `eslint.config.js` importing from `@repo/eslint-config/base` for lint to work
  - Use `@repo/typescript-config/base.json` (not react-library) for Node.js-only packages
  - Package `type: "module"` and `.js` extensions in imports are required for NodeNext module resolution
  - The `parseDiffNameStatus` function is exported separately so it can be unit-tested without git
  - Route inference confidence levels help the browser agent prioritize which routes to visit

## 2026-02-28 - US-003
- Created `dev-server.ts` in `packages/core/src/` with dev server lifecycle management
- `startDevServer()`: spawns dev process in background, polls for HTTP readiness, returns handle with kill()
- `httpCheck()`: single HTTP GET probe to localhost port
- `waitForPort()`: polls with configurable timeout (default 60s) and interval (default 500ms)
- `findActivePort()`: scans common ports (3000, 5173, 8080, 4200, 4321, 8000) as fallback
- `resolveDevCommand()`: derives `npm run <script>` from WebAppInfo
- Handles already-running servers (returns no-op handle)
- Uses `detached: true` + process group kill for clean cleanup
- Updated skill prompt Step 2 with detailed server startup instructions
- Files changed: `packages/core/src/dev-server.ts` (new), `packages/core/src/index.ts` (updated), `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `process.kill(-pid, 'SIGTERM')` for process group cleanup (negative PID kills the group)
  - Set `FORCE_COLOR=0` env var to avoid ANSI escapes in captured output
  - Always check if port is already in use before spawning — avoids double-server issues
  - `detached: true` with `stdio: ["ignore", "pipe", "pipe"]` prevents zombie processes

## 2026-02-28 - US-004
- Created `browser-recorder.ts` in `packages/core/src/` with recording session orchestration
- `createSession()`: initializes recording session with ID, routes, output dir
- `createOutputDir()`: creates `demos/[timestamp]/screenshots/` structure
- `addStep()`: logs actions (navigate, click, type, screenshot) with timestamps
- `buildNavigationScript()`: converts InferredRoute[] to full URL list
- `writeSummary()`: generates `summary.md` with routes, steps, and diff context
- `buildLaminarMetadata()`: prepares Laminar tracing config for browser-use runs
- `buildSupermemoryQuery()`: prepares Supermemory context retrieval query
- Updated skill prompt Step 3 with detailed browser-use + Playwright instructions
- Files changed: `packages/core/src/browser-recorder.ts` (new), `packages/core/src/index.ts` (updated), `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - browser-use npm package is built on Playwright — use Playwright directly for screenshots/video recording
  - Playwright `recordVideo: { dir, size }` in context options auto-saves video on context close
  - browser-use Agent takes `{ task, llm }` — configure with routes and diff context as the task description
  - Laminar and Supermemory are optional integrations — gate on env vars (LAMINAR_ENDPOINT, SUPERMEMORY_ENDPOINT)
  - Session ID format YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS doubles as the demos/ subfolder name

## 2026-02-28 - US-005
- Created `interaction-planner.ts` in `packages/core/src/` for AI-driven interaction planning
- `extractInteractiveElements()`: parses diff hunks for added HTML/JSX elements (button, input, form, etc.), ARIA roles, and event handlers (onClick, onSubmit, onChange)
- Smart selector extraction with priority: id > data-testid > aria-label > className > text content > tag fallback
- `generateInteractionPlan()`: maps elements to routes, deduplicates, sorts by confidence then action type, returns structured step list
- Graceful handling: missing elements are skipped without failing the recording
- Updated skill prompt Step 4 with detailed interaction plan generation and execution instructions
- Files changed: `packages/core/src/interaction-planner.ts` (new), `packages/core/src/index.ts` (updated), `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use global regex patterns with `lastIndex = 0` reset before each test to avoid missed matches
  - Selector extraction from JSX is best-effort — data-testid is the most reliable
  - Event handler detection (onClick etc.) serves as a fallback when no HTML element is directly visible in the diff
  - Diff hunks keyed by file path allow mapping elements back to their source route
  - Wait times vary by action: 500ms for clicks, 2000ms for form submissions

## 2026-02-28 - US-006
- Created `video-processor.ts` in `packages/core/src/` for Screen Studio-style post-processing
- `interpolateCursorPath()`: cubic bezier interpolation between cursor keyframes, deterministic output
- `generateZoomKeyframes()`: creates zoom-in effects on click/type actions
- `getZoomAtTime()`: frame-level zoom with asymmetric easing (30% zoom-in, 70% zoom-out)
- Three style presets: default (balanced), minimal (subtle), dramatic (deep zoom + dark bg)
- `buildFFmpegCompositeCommand()`: generates FFmpeg command for H.264 MP4 with cursor overlay + zoom
- `prepareVideoProcessing()`: full pipeline — builds cursor path, zoom keyframes, manifest, FFmpeg command
- `writeRenderManifest()`: writes render-manifest.json with all processing metadata
- Updated skill prompt Step 5 with detailed post-processing instructions
- Files changed: `packages/core/src/video-processor.ts` (new), `packages/core/src/index.ts` (updated), `.claude/commands/record-demo.md` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ESLint in this project treats `_` prefixed unused params as warnings too — remove unused params entirely instead
  - Cubic bezier with control points along x-axis only produces natural horizontal cursor arcs
  - Asymmetric zoom (fast in, slow out) feels more natural than symmetric — use 30/70 split
  - FFmpeg `-movflags +faststart` is essential for web playback (moves moov atom to start)
  - `zoompan` filter in FFmpeg can do per-frame zoom but syntax is complex for dynamic keyframes
  - Render manifest JSON captures all processing metadata for debugging and reproducibility
