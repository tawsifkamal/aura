      "REASONING: The agent successfully completed both steps of the task in the correct order. For Step 1, it navigated to the site, entered the correct credentials ('admin'/'password123'), waited as instructed, and clicked sign-in, resulting in the appearance of the success banner. For Step 2, it re-navigated to the page, entered incorrect credentials ('hacker'/'wrongpass'), and successfully triggered the error banner. The agent followed the specific recording instructions regarding pauses between actions (using wait commands) and pauses between steps. Screenshots confirm the presence of both the success-banner (green) and error-banner (red) as required by the verification steps.\n",
